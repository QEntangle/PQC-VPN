cat /etc/ipsec.conf >> migration-audit.txt
echo "" >> migration-audit.txt
echo "--- /etc/strongswan.conf ---" >> migration-audit.txt
cat /etc/strongswan.conf >> migration-audit.txt
```

### 2. User and Certificate Inventory

```bash
# List all certificates with details
for cert in /etc/ipsec.d/certs/*.pem; do
    echo "Certificate: $cert"
    openssl x509 -in "$cert" -noout -subject -issuer -dates
    echo "---"
done > certificate-inventory.txt

# List all users (if using PQC-VPN user management)
if command -v pqc-vpn-manager > /dev/null; then
    pqc-vpn-manager user list --format json > user-inventory.json
fi
```

### 3. Network Configuration

```bash
# Document network configuration
echo "Network Configuration:" > network-config.txt
ip addr show >> network-config.txt
ip route show >> network-config.txt
iptables -L -n >> network-config.txt
```

## Backup Procedures

### 1. Complete Configuration Backup

```bash
# Create comprehensive backup
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/pqc-vpn-migration-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Configuration files
cp -r /etc/ipsec.d "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp /etc/ipsec.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp /etc/ipsec.secrets "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp /etc/strongswan.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/"

# Logs
cp -r /var/log/strongswan "$BACKUP_DIR/logs/" 2>/dev/null || true

# User database (if exists)
cp /var/lib/pqc-vpn/vpn_manager.db "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null || true

# Custom configurations
cp -r /etc/pqc-vpn "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null || true

# Create archive
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" -C "$(dirname "$BACKUP_DIR")" "$(basename "$BACKUP_DIR")"

echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz"
```

### 2. Certificate Export

```bash
# Export certificates in multiple formats for compatibility
CERT_EXPORT_DIR="/tmp/cert-export"
mkdir -p "$CERT_EXPORT_DIR"

for cert in /etc/ipsec.d/certs/*.pem; do
    basename=$(basename "$cert" .pem)
    
    # Copy original
    cp "$cert" "$CERT_EXPORT_DIR/"
    
    # Export as DER
    openssl x509 -in "$cert" -outform DER -out "$CERT_EXPORT_DIR/${basename}.der"
    
    # Export certificate info
    openssl x509 -in "$cert" -noout -text > "$CERT_EXPORT_DIR/${basename}.txt"
done

# Export private keys (secure handling required)
for key in /etc/ipsec.d/private/*.pem; do
    basename=$(basename "$key" .pem)
    cp "$key" "$CERT_EXPORT_DIR/"
done

tar -czf cert-export-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /tmp cert-export
```

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Installation (Recommended)

This is the cleanest migration path for production environments.

#### Step 1: Prepare New Environment

```bash
# 1. Provision new server/container
# 2. Install OpenSSL 3.5 PQC-VPN
git clone https://github.com/QEntangle/PQC-VPN.git
cd PQC-VPN
git checkout openssl-3.5-migration

# For Docker deployment
export HUB_IP=your-new-ip
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.openssl35.yml up -d

# For native Linux installation
sudo ./scripts/install-hub-linux-openssl35.sh --hub-ip YOUR_NEW_IP
```

#### Step 2: Certificate Migration

```bash
# Option A: Regenerate certificates (recommended)
# This ensures optimal compatibility with OpenSSL 3.5
sudo pqc-keygen-openssl35 ca --key-type rsa --key-size 4096 --force
sudo pqc-keygen-openssl35 server hub.domain.com --key-type rsa --key-size 4096

# Option B: Import existing certificates
# Copy certificates from backup
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/cacerts/* /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/certs/* /etc/ipsec.d/certs/
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/private/* /etc/ipsec.d/private/

# Verify certificate compatibility
/usr/local/openssl35/bin/openssl verify -CAfile /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/ca-cert.pem /etc/ipsec.d/certs/hub-cert.pem
```

#### Step 3: Configuration Migration

```bash
# Migrate strongSwan configuration
# The OpenSSL 3.5 installation creates optimized configurations
# Review and merge any custom settings from backup

# Compare configurations
diff backup/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.conf
diff backup/strongswan.conf /etc/strongswan.conf

# Merge custom settings as needed
```

#### Step 4: User Migration

```bash
# Migrate users from old system
# If using PQC-VPN user management:

# Export users from old system (before migration)
pqc-vpn-manager user list --format json > users-export.json

# Import users to new system
for user in $(jq -r '.[].username' users-export.json); do
    email=$(jq -r ".[] | select(.username==\"$user\") | .email" users-export.json)
    auth_type=$(jq -r ".[] | select(.username==\"$user\") | .auth_type" users-export.json)
    
    pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 user add "$user" "$email" --auth-type "$auth_type"
done
```

#### Step 5: Testing and Validation

```bash
# Verify OpenSSL 3.5 functionality
/usr/local/openssl35/bin/openssl version
/usr/local/openssl35/bin/openssl list -algorithms

# Test VPN functionality
systemctl status strongswan
ipsec statusall

# Performance testing
pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 benchmark --duration 60

# Security validation
pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 cert verify /etc/ipsec.d/certs/hub-cert.pem
```

### Scenario 2: In-Place Migration

For development or testing environments where downtime is acceptable.

#### Step 1: Stop Services

```bash
# Stop current PQC-VPN services
systemctl stop strongswan
systemctl stop pqc-vpn-web 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Step 2: Backup and Clean

```bash
# Complete backup (as shown above)
# Remove old liboqs components
sudo apt-get remove liboqs* oqs-openssl* 2>/dev/null || true
sudo yum remove liboqs* oqs-openssl* 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Step 3: Install OpenSSL 3.5

```bash
# Run OpenSSL 3.5 installation
sudo ./scripts/install-hub-linux-openssl35.sh --hub-ip YOUR_IP --no-cert

# Restore certificates from backup
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/cacerts/* /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/certs/* /etc/ipsec.d/certs/
sudo cp backup/ipsec.d/private/* /etc/ipsec.d/private/

# Set proper permissions
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ipsec.d/private/*
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ipsec.d/certs/*
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts/*
```

#### Step 4: Configuration Update

```bash
# The installation creates new optimized configurations
# Merge any custom settings from backup

# Start services
systemctl start strongswan
systemctl start pqc-vpn
```

## Post-Migration Tasks

### 1. Performance Validation

# VPN performance
echo "VPN Performance:" >> migration-validation.txt
pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 benchmark --duration 30 >> migration-validation.txt

# System resources
echo "System Resources:" >> migration-validation.txt
free -h >> migration-validation.txt
df -h >> migration-validation.txt
```

### 2. Security Validation

```bash
# Verify all certificates
echo "Certificate Validation:" >> migration-validation.txt
for cert in /etc/ipsec.d/certs/*.pem; do
    echo "Validating: $cert" >> migration-validation.txt
    /usr/local/openssl35/bin/openssl x509 -in "$cert" -noout -verify >> migration-validation.txt 2>&1
done

# strongSwan configuration check
ipsec checkconfig >> migration-validation.txt
```

### 3. Client Updates

```bash
# Generate new client configurations for OpenSSL 3.5
for user in $(pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 user list --format json | jq -r '.[].username'); do
    echo "Generating client bundle for: $user"
    pqc-vpn-manager-openssl35 bundle "$user" "/tmp/client-bundles/"
done

# Create client update packages
tar -czf client-bundles-openssl35.tar.gz -C /tmp client-bundles/
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Verify monitoring stack
systemctl status prometheus
systemctl status grafana-server

# Check metrics collection
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up | jq .

# Verify dashboard access
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Rollback Procedures

In case of issues, you can rollback to the previous version:

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Stop new services
systemctl stop strongswan
systemctl stop pqc-vpn

# Restore from backup
BACKUP_FILE="/var/backups/pqc-vpn-migration-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz"
tar -xzf "$BACKUP_FILE" -C /tmp

# Restore configuration
sudo cp -r /tmp/backup-*/ipsec.d/* /etc/ipsec.d/
sudo cp /tmp/backup-*/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.conf
sudo cp /tmp/backup-*/ipsec.secrets /etc/ipsec.secrets
sudo cp /tmp/backup-*/strongswan.conf /etc/strongswan.conf

# Reinstall liboqs (if needed)
# [Previous installation commands]

# Restart services
systemctl start strongswan
```
